# RAG-model-with-QA-bot-

# Interactive QA Bot  This project implements a **QA Bot** using Pinecone, Cohere, and a PDF document as a knowledge base. Users can upload a PDF file, ask questions based on the content of the document, and get answers.  The application uses: - **Streamlit** for the web interface - **Pinecone** for vector storage and retrieval - **Cohere** for generating answers based on the retrieved document segments - **Sentence Transformers** to generate embeddings  ## Table of Contents  - [Features](#features) - [Setup and Installation](#setup-and-installation) - [Running the Application](#running-the-application) - [Docker Deployment](#docker-deployment) - [Usage](#usage)  ## Features  - Upload a PDF document and convert it into embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`. - Store embeddings in Pinecone for fast retrieval. - Ask questions based on the content of the uploaded PDF. - Cohere generates responses based on the retrieved content. - Containerized for easy deployment using Docker.  ## Setup and Installation  ### Prerequisites  - Python 3.8+ - Docker (for containerization) - [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) API key - [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/) API key  ### Clone the Repository  ```bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git cd your-repo
